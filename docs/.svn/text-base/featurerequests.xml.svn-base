      <title>Distribution-specific checks</title>

      <note>
        <para>This request is still in draft (meaning it has not been
        started). Feedback (or perhaps even patches) are greatly
        appreciated.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Support a distribution specific check script (most likely using
      the cvechecker output) that investigates if a vulnerability hasn't been
      solved by the distribution itself through an applied patch (rather than
      a version upgrade). The check script itself should be a wrapper that
      detects on which distribution the script is being ran (/etc/*release)
      and then calls the script particularly made for that distribution (on a
      predefined location, say lib/cvechecker/scripts).</para>

      <para>The distribution-specific scripts must adhere to a predefined
      input/output scheme, returncodes and such.</para>

      <para>They should support a human-friendly and computer-parsable
      output.</para>

      <para>A sample script is available in the cvechecker distribution,
